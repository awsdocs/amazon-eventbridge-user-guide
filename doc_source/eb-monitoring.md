# Monitoring Amazon EventBridge<a name="eb-monitoring"></a>

EventBridge sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch every minute for everything from the number of matched [events](eb-events.md) to the number of times a [target](eb-targets.md) is invoked by a [rule](eb-rules.md)\.

## EventBridge metrics<a name="eb-metrics"></a>

The `AWS/Events` namespace includes the following metrics\.

 All of these metrics use Count as the unit, so Sum and SampleCount are the most useful statistics\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `DeadLetterInvocations`  |  The number of times a ruleâ€™s target isn't invoked in response to an event\. This includes invocations that would result in running the same rule again, causing an infinite loop\. Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `FailedInvocations`  |  The number of invocations that failed permanently\. This doesn't include invocations that are retried or invocations that succeeded after a retry attempt\. It also doesn't count failed invocations that are counted in `DeadLetterInvocations`\. Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `Invocations`  |  The number of times a target is invoked by a rule in response to an event\. This includes successful and failed invocations, but doesn't include throttled or retried attempts until they fail permanently\. It doessn't include `DeadLetterInvocations`\.  EventBridge only sends this metric to CloudWatch if it isn't zero\.  Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `InvocationsFailedToBeSentToDlq`  |  The number of invocations that couldn't be moved to a dead\-letter queue\. Dead\-letter queue errors occur due to permissions errors, unavailable resources, or size limits\.  EventBridge only sends this metric to CloudWatch if it isn't zero\.  Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `InvocationsSentToDlq`  |  The number of invocations that are moved to a dead\-letter queue\.  EventBridge only sends this metric to CloudWatch if it isn't zero\.  Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `ThrottledRules`  |  The number of rules that have tried to run but are being throttled\. Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `TriggeredRules`  |  The number of rules that have run and matched with any event\. You won't see this metric in CloudWatch until a rule is triggered\. Valid Dimensions: EventBusName, RuleName Units: Count  | 
|  `MatchedEvents`  |  The number of events that matched with any rule\. Valid Dimensions: None Units: Count  | 

## Dimensions for EventBridge metrics<a name="eb-metrics-dimensions"></a>

EventBridge metrics have two *dimensions*, or sortable attribute, which is listed below\.


|  Dimension  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- |
